    <p>Nasi Goreng, meaning literally "fried rice" in Indonesian and Malay, is much more than a simple dish—it's Indonesia's national stir-fry and a beloved staple across Southeast Asia. Characterized by its smoky, savory-sweet flavor profile and rich, dark color, this street food favorite is typically made from day-old cooked rice stir-fried rapidly in a hot wok with bumbu (spice paste), aromatic shallots, garlic, tamarind, and the essential ingredient: kecap manis (sweet soy sauce). The deep complexity of flavor comes from this thick, molasses-like sweet soy sauce, which caramelizes slightly during the high-heat cooking process, giving nasi goreng its signature allure.</p>

    <p>A perfect plate of nasi goreng is a harmonious composition of textures and tastes, often customized with local additions. While the base usually includes chicken, shrimp, or scrambled egg, it's the garnishes that complete the experience. The dish is traditionally served with Acar (pickled vegetables), krupuk (crispy crackers), and topped with a glistening fried egg (known as mata sapi, or "cow's eye"), providing a rich, runny yolk that mixes into the savory rice. Whether grabbed quickly from a street cart (gerobak) or served at a formal dinner, nasi goreng remains a testament to simple ingredients transformed into a complex and satisfying culinary delight.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>cooking spray</li>
        <li>3 large eggs, beaten</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
        <li>1 leek, chopped</li>
        <li>2 green chile peppers, chopped</li>
        <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
        <li>½ pound skinless, boneless chicken breasts, cut into thin strips</li>
        <li>½ pound peeled and deveined shrimp</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground coriander</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
        <li>3 cups cold cooked white rice</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons kecap manis (sweet soy sauce)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat a large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Coat with nonstick cooking spray.</li>
        <li>Pour eggs into the hot skillet and cook until the edges begin to set. Lift the edges to allow any uncooked egg to flow onto the hot pan, about 1 minute. Flip omelet in one piece and cook until fully set, about 30 seconds. Transfer omelet to a cutting board and slice into 1/2-inch strips. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Heat vegetable oil in a wok or large frying pan over high heat. Stir in onion, leek, chile peppers, and garlic. Cook and stir until onion is soft, 3 to 5 minutes. Stir in chicken, shrimp, coriander, and cumin; mix well. Cook and stir for about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Mix in cooked rice, sweet soy sauce, and omelet strips; cook until rice is heated through and chicken is no longer pink in the center, 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
